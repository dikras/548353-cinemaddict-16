  'Oscar-winning film, a war drama about two young people, from the creators of timeless classic "Nu, Pogodi!" and "Alice in Wonderland", with the best fight scenes since Bruce Lee.',
  'The film opens following a murder at a cabaret in Mexico City in 1936, and then presents the events leading up to it in flashback. The Great Flamarion (Erich von Stroheim) is an arrogant, friendless, and misogynous marksman who displays his trick gunshot act in the vaudeville circuit. His show features a beautiful assistant, Connie (Mary Beth Hughes) and her drunken husband Al (Dan Duryea), Flamarion\'s other assistant. Flamarion falls in love with Connie, the movie\'s femme fatale, and is soon manipulated by her into killing her no good husband during one of their acts.',
  'Sentenced for a murder he did not commit, John Brant escapes from prison determined to find the real killer. By chance Brant\'s narrow escape from lawmen is witnessed by Joseph Conlon who goes by the name of "Jones".',
  'In this short, Sindbad the Sailor (who is intended to be an alternate version of Popeye\'s old nemesis Bluto) lives on an island where he keeps loads of creatures that he had captured during his adventures (lions, tigers, giants, dragons, vultures, snakes, and apes).',
  'John Mason is a young, somewhat timid attorney in New York City. He has been doing his job well.'];
